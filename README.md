# FaceDetection

In this project, we aim to realize a face detection model from a binary data set, face or not face. We divide our task into two parts. In the first part, we need to train some face classifiers with different strategies. In the second part, we choose the best model and implement advanced algorithms and models to detect faces on new test pictures.
